# Angular 2 Javascript Quickstart

## Lesson materials for an Angular 2 Javascript workshop

In this workshop we are going to build a small Angular application that displays views for Star Wars actors. We are going to use plain javascript, without a compilation step. This workshop is based on the Javascript Quickstart on http://angular.io

### Download 

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/KokoDoko/angular-js-quickstart  mijn-project
cd mijn-project
```
Discard everything "git-like" by deleting the .git folder.

```bash
rm -rf .git  # non-Windows
rd .git /S/Q # windows
```

### Install

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:

`npm install`

### Start

`npm start`

This quickstart includes a server that automatically shows and reloads the page you are developing in a localhost environment. This is not a part of Angular, but it speeds op your development process!
